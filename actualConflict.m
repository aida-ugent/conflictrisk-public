function conflict = actualConflict(m,L)
% actualConflict.m

% Description: compute the actual conflict for the three different 
% internal opinion vectors:
%                           s1 - the random one consists of -1 and 1;
%                           s2 - corresponds to the 10th samllest eigenvalue; 
% low-frequency on the graph;
%                           s3 - corresponds to the 10th largest eigenvalue;
% high-frequency on the graph

% Input:
%       m - represents the measure;
%       L - the laplacian matrix of the current network;

% Output:
%       conflict - the real conflict for the three internal opinion vectors
